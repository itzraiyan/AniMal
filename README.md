## ▶️ One-Command Run Setup

You can set up AniMal so you can just type `AniMal` from anywhere in your terminal to launch the program — no need to type `python main.py` every time!

### Linux

```bash
echo "alias AniMal='python3 $HOME/AniMal/main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you're using Zsh:

```bash
echo "alias AniMal='python3 $HOME/AniMal/main.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Android (Termux)

```bash
echo "alias AniMal='python $HOME/AniMal/main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows

**Option 1: Using a batch file (recommended for beginners)**

1. Open Notepad and paste:

   ```bat
   @echo off
   python "%USERPROFILE%\AniMal\main.py" %*
   ```

   *(Adjust the path if you cloned AniMal elsewhere)*

2. Save as `AniMal.bat` in a folder that's in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows` or add a folder like `C:\Users\YourName\bin` to your PATH).

3. Now you can open Command Prompt and run:

   ```
   AniMal
   ```

**Option 2: Add Python scripts to PATH and create a shortcut**

* You can create a shortcut to `python.exe` with the argument `"C:\Path\To\AniMal\main.py"` and place it on your Desktop or in a folder in your PATH.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Run the tool:**
   Open your terminal and type:

   ```
   AniMal
   ```

   *(Or `python main.py` if you haven't set up the one-click launcher)*

2. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**
   AniMal guides you step-by-step. You can type `-help` at any prompt for context help!

   * **Enter AniList username:**
     Your AniList username (see your AniList profile page for your username).

   * **Want to include private AniList entries?**
     If you want to include private entries, you'll be guided through AniList's OAuth process:

     1. **Create an AniList Application:**
        - Go to [AniList Developer Settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer)
        - Click "Create New Client"
        - Name it (e.g., AniMal Exporter) and set the redirect URL to `https://localhost/` or any URL you like.
        - After creating, copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

     2. **Authorize AniMal:**
        - AniMal will show you an authorization URL to visit in your browser.
        - Log in to AniList, approve the permissions, and you'll be redirected (the URL will contain `?code=...`).
        - Copy the full redirected URL and paste it into AniMal.

     3. **Token is handled for you:**
        - AniMal extracts the token and uses it automatically.
        - You can now export both public and private entries.

     *(If you skip this step, only public entries will be exported.)*

   * **Enter MAL username (optional):**
     For best compatibility when importing to MAL, enter your MAL username (or skip).

   * **Choose export type:**
     * 1: Anime only
     * 2: Manga only
     * 3: Both anime and manga (default)

   * **Filter by status?**
     Want only completed, dropped, or a custom selection? Type `y` and select from the grid shown. Or just press Enter for all.

   * **Filter by title substring?**
     Want only entries with a certain word in the title? Enter `y` and specify the word.

3. **Done!**
   Your exported XML files will appear in the `output/` directory, ready to import into MyAnimeList.

## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need my AniList or MAL password?**
A: **Never!** AniMal will *never* ask for your password. To access private entries, you authorize using AniList's official OAuth process (ID, secret, and browser-based approval).

**Q: Where are my exported files?**
A: In the `output/` folder, as XML files:

* `your_anilist_username_anime.xml`
* `your_anilist_username_manga.xml`

**Q: What does the export include?**
A: Titles, scores (1–10), progress (episodes/chapters), status, dates, and your personal notes.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile or in Termux?**
A: Yes! AniMal is tested to work in Termux (Android), Linux, and Windows terminals.

**Q: Something went wrong, how do I get help?**
A: Type `-help` at any prompt for instant guidance, or [open an issue](https://github.com/itzraiyan/AniMal/issues).

## 📦 Understanding the Generated XML Files

AniMal generates XML files that are **fully compatible with MyAnimeList (MAL)**. These files are rich, detailed, and advanced, containing everything MAL expects for a smooth import. Here’s what you get:

- **User Block (`myinfo`):**
  - Your username and user ID (if MAL username provided)
  - Export type (anime or manga)
  - Total count of entries and advanced stats (completed, watching/reading, on-hold, dropped, plan to watch/read, etc.)

- **Entry Blocks (`anime` or `manga`):**
  - **IDs:** Both AniList and MAL database IDs when available
  - **Title:** Full romanized title (with support for special characters)
  - **Episodes/Chapters/Volumes:** All progress recorded
  - **Status:** Accurate mapping from AniList (including "repeating", "paused", etc.)
  - **Dates:** Start and finish dates (in proper MAL format)
  - **Scores:** 1–10 scale, supports decimal and integer scores
  - **Notes/Comments:** Any notes you’ve attached on AniList are preserved
  - **Tags:** (if available)
  - **Rewatch/Re-read status:** Progress and flags
  - **Privacy:** Both public and private entries (if you used OAuth)

- **Advanced Features:**
  - All fields are mapped intelligently so MAL can import them without errors.
  - Handles edge cases like missing values, partial progress, unknown titles, and more.
  - Output is **standards-compliant XML**—no hacks, no missing data, no broken imports.

**Why is this awesome?**  
AniMal’s export is not a basic list dump: it’s a complete, detailed, and robust migration tool. Whether you’re a power user with tons of custom notes, a casual with only partial lists, or someone with lots of private entries—everything is exported, safely and accurately.
